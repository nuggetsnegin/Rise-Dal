##Rise@Dal Community Outreach Project
For Michelle Stone and Dan Stevens who require additional administrative features from the website developed partly last term, the Rise@Work website is a web application that allows users to track their personal step count and allows researchers to export user data. Unlike the current version of the site, originally built for the University of Toronto, our product allows for custom consent forms and map, accelerated program testing, as well as improved Excel data reports.

##SCOPE
The important goals and objectives that have been identified by the client in the RFP can be summarized into five specific points. Each point represents one new desired feature for the Rise@Work website:

●	Ability to send and receive emails from a registered DAL email address (rise@dal.ca) in a more controlled way: both automatically, for phase completion/activity reminders, and manually to message individual participants, acting as true research administrators.

●	Ability to download all relevant data as a report in an Excel spreadsheet (not just daily steps): participant daily steps, summaries of steps in the various research phases, use of walking maps, behaviour change,strategies, etc.

●	The means to change/update consent forms to suit the client’s research protocol and team as well as Dalhousie University’s ethics requirements.

●	A feature that allows the deselection of University of Toronto maps to view maps of Dalhousie and the surrounding area.

●	Ability to perform accelerated research program testing instead of completing a real time cycle of the eleven week program.\

● Map selection and deselection for routing.

● Client documentation and training.
